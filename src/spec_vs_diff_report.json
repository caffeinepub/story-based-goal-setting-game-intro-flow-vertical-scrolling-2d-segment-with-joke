  "summary": "REQ-12 appears implemented via an updated controls legend string in GameView. REQ-11 appears implemented via collectible generation changes in worldMap to push the first star farther from spawn while keeping 7 total. However, the diff also indicates unrequested gameplay/world changes (notably corridor length increase and added/changed pickup SFX/spin behavior), which conflict with stated constraints/non-goals.",
