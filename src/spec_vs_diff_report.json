  "summary": "All three requested areas appear to be implemented: IntroFlow layout has an added ~25vh top offset, Continue/Submit buttons use a unified pill/outline style, and the canvas game movement/camera feel was updated to smooth held-key movement with deltaTime updates and continuous top-to-bottom world scrolling. The diff also introduces several extra gameplay/intro behaviors not requested (e.g., Spacebar jokes/speech balloon and timing changes).",

    {
      "description": "Added Spacebar-triggered random jokes displayed in a speech balloon during gameplay.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 only asked for movement + camera feel adjustments; it explicitly scoped to movement/camera and did not request jokes/speech UI.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/game/GameView.tsx (imports jokes, SpeechBalloon, handleSpacePress)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (GameView, jokes.ts, SpeechBalloon.tsx entries)"

    {
      "description": "Introduced/modified intro pacing constants to 1000ms delays (LINE_REVEAL_DELAY and FEEDBACK_DELAY) and staged behavior around showing Continue after feedback.",
      "reason": "REQ-1/REQ-2 focus on layout offset and button styling; they do not request changing narrative reveal timing or adding delayed Continue gating after slider feedback.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/intro/IntroFlow.tsx (comment: LINE_REVEAL_DELAY = 1000)",

    {
      "description": "Added automatic top-to-bottom world progression via a constant WORLD_SCROLL_SPEED (auto-scrolling), beyond just camera feel tuning.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 requires top-to-bottom map progression and camera-like scrolling, but the explicit addition of automatic scrolling speed is an implementation choice not directly requested; included here as a potential scope expansion (though consistent with AC).",
