  "summary": "A React + TypeScript single-page app with a story-driven, multi-stage intro experience (timed narrative reveals, user-gated progression, and mood-darkening gradient transitions plus a slider-based question) that transitions into a small 2D top-down canvas game. In the game, the player moves a Donald pixel character through a narrow, strictly linear, downward-progressing corridor world with gentle curves, while a smooth camera follows; obstacles block movement via collisions with wall-sliding; pressing J shows a random joke in a timed speech balloon overlay; pressing Space performs an action and can also pick up nearby collectibles. The game includes a goals modal on first movement and a 0/7 collectibles HUD with per-star pickup modals; after the 7th pickup modal is closed, gameplay ends and the app transitions into an outro narrative flow using the same line-by-line reveal + gated Continue pattern as the intro. The repo also includes scaffolding for Internet Identity authentication and identity-aware backend actor creation via React Query, plus a reusable build-template directory containing ICP canister configs, frontend tooling, shadcn/ui component set, and deploy/build scripts for packaging/export.",

    "IntroFlow is implemented as an explicit stage/state machine (FlowStage union) coordinated by multiple useEffect timers for line-by-line reveals and gated progression.",
    "Intro mood progression uses OKLCH-based CSS gradients computed in a helper (getBackgroundGradient) and crossfaded via layered full-screen divs with opacity transitions.",
    "Gameplay rendering is imperative Canvas2D drawing inside a React component; simulation runs in a requestAnimationFrame loop (useGameLoop) with deltaTime in seconds for frame-rate-independent movement.",
    "Per-frame gameplay state (character position, camera position) is stored in refs to avoid React re-renders; React state is reserved for UI overlays (joke balloon) and asset-load status.",
    "Keyboard input is encapsulated in a hook (useKeyboardControls) that gates controls behind a canvas focus concept and uses window-level key listeners.",
    "World geometry (bounds, floor tile regions, obstacles) and physics helpers (clamping, collision) are separated into a dedicated module (worldMap.ts); corridor floor/walls are generated procedurally from a centerline path definition.",
    "Styling uses Tailwind CSS with OKLCH token theming, tailwindcss-animate, and shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Slider).",
    "ICP scaffolding: InternetIdentityProvider wraps @dfinity/auth-client; useActor creates/caches an anonymous or identity-bound backend actor using TanStack React Query and invalidates/refetches non-actor queries when the actor changes.",
    "Repository now includes a build-template/ scaffold for ICP projects: canister YAMLs, deploy/build scripts, frontend tooling (Vite/Tailwind), shadcn/ui component library sources, and custom ESLint rules to enforce Internet Identity provider usage and safe React Query key patterns."

  "known_issues": [
    "Camera clamping assumes world bounds are larger than the viewport; with a corridor world that can be narrower than the 500px canvas, horizontal camera clamping can collapse to a constant value (camera X becomes effectively fixed).",
    "Backend canister (backend/main.mo) is an empty actor with no methods; the auth/actor scaffolding currently has no functional backend API to call.",
    "Duplicate/global CSS entrypoints exist (frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css); only src/index.css is imported by the app, but the extra file can confuse maintenance."
