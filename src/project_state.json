  "summary": "A React + TypeScript single-page app with a story-driven, multi-stage intro experience (timed narrative reveals, user-gated progression, and mood-darkening gradient transitions plus a slider-based question) that transitions into a small 2D top-down canvas game. In the game, the player moves a Donald pixel character through a narrow, strictly linear, downward-progressing corridor world with gentle curves, while a smooth camera follows; obstacles block movement via collisions with wall-sliding; pressing J shows a random joke in a timed speech balloon overlay; pressing Space performs an action and can also pick up nearby collectibles. The game includes a goals modal on first movement and a 0/7 collectibles HUD with per-star pickup modals; after the 7th pickup modal is closed, gameplay ends and the app transitions into an outro narrative flow using the same line-by-line reveal + gated Continue pattern as the intro. The repo also includes scaffolding for Internet Identity authentication and identity-aware backend actor creation via React Query, plus a reusable build-template directory containing ICP canister configs, frontend tooling, shadcn/ui component set, and deploy/build scripts for packaging/export.",

  "architectural_notes": [
    "React + TypeScript SPA with feature-based organization (src/features/intro, src/features/game) and centralized story content (src/content/story.ts).",
    "IntroFlow is implemented as an explicit stage/state machine (FlowStage union) coordinated by multiple useEffect timers for line-by-line reveals and gated progression.",
    "Intro mood progression uses OKLCH-based CSS gradients computed in a helper (getBackgroundGradient) and crossfaded via layered full-screen divs with opacity transitions.",
    "Gameplay rendering is imperative Canvas2D drawing inside a React component; simulation runs in a requestAnimationFrame loop (useGameLoop) with deltaTime in seconds for frame-rate-independent movement.",
    "Per-frame gameplay state (character position, camera position) is stored in refs to avoid React re-renders; React state is reserved for UI overlays (joke balloon) and asset-load status.",
    "Keyboard input is encapsulated in a hook (useKeyboardControls) that gates controls behind a canvas focus concept and uses window-level key listeners.",
    "World geometry (bounds, floor tile regions, obstacles) and physics helpers (clamping, collision) are separated into a dedicated module (worldMap.ts); corridor floor/walls are generated procedurally from a centerline path definition.",
    "Styling uses Tailwind CSS with OKLCH token theming, tailwindcss-animate, and shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Slider).",
    "ICP scaffolding: InternetIdentityProvider wraps @dfinity/auth-client; useActor creates/caches an anonymous or identity-bound backend actor using TanStack React Query and invalidates/refetches non-actor queries when the actor changes.",
    "Repository now includes a build-template/ scaffold for ICP projects: canister YAMLs, deploy/build scripts, frontend tooling (Vite/Tailwind), shadcn/ui component library sources, and custom ESLint rules to enforce Internet Identity provider usage and safe React Query key patterns.",
    "Gameplay input handling has been simplified so keyboard controls are always active, removing the prior canvas-focus gating concept in useKeyboardControls/GameView.",
    "GameView now reuses the intro background/gradient system to provide consistent mood styling behind the canvas UI.",
    "Corridor/obstacle generation must guarantee at least one continuous passable path forward (no full-width impassable walling).",
    "Gameplay layout: the removable descriptive text (“Donald explores the landscape of his ambitions…”) is located below the game container; rounded corners should apply to the entire game container (canvas + HUD/controls), clearly rounded.",
    "Corridor wall/obstacle placement is constrained to ensure forward progress by enforcing openings/gaps and preventing any full-width impassable segments in the 3-unit corridor.",
    "Gameplay layout no longer includes the extra descriptive narrative line beneath the game view; the container styling was updated so rounded corners wrap the entire game module (canvas + HUD/controls).",
    "Corridor generation should use a path-first approach (carve/validate a continuous passable lane from start to end) and only then decorate with obstacles constrained not to block that guaranteed path; acceptable to rework the generator rather than patching with ad-hoc checks.",
    "Corridor generation now follows a path-first approach: carve/validate a continuous passable lane, then place walls/obstacles with constraints so they cannot block the validated path (supported by a dedicated passability module).",
    "Gameplay input mapping updated: jokes are triggered by 'J'; Space is used for a character action animation; movement remains Arrow keys.",
    "Introduce gameplay progression UI: trigger a modal 0.5s after the first detected player movement input; add a HUD that tracks a set of uniquely collected items (7 total) and renders a 0/7 counter plus star indicators.",
    "Collectibles HUD implemented as a dedicated component that tracks unique collectible pickups (7 total) and renders star indicators plus a 0/7 counter.",
    "Star/collectible pickup should be input-gated: pressing Space while within a proximity radius triggers pickup; consider prioritizing pickup over the Space action animation when in range.",
    "Map scaling clarification: expand world height only by ~2.5× while keeping corridor width unchanged.",
    "Star pickup interaction clarification: require Space press when almost touching a star; Space should both trigger pickup (when in range) and still perform the action animation.",
    "First-movement GoalsModal timing updated: trigger after 0.2s (was 0.5s).",
    "Add SFX hook/asset for star pickup feedback sound.",
    "Collectibles HUD UI is positioned top-right and rendered borderless within the rounded game container.",
    "Collectible pickup logic is input-gated: pressing Space while within a tight proximity triggers pickup; Space continues to also trigger the action animation when used.",
    "World scaling updated to extend corridor/world height by ~2.5× while keeping corridor width unchanged.",
    "Star pickup plays an SFX; audio/sfx behavior is encapsulated via a small hook/utility and triggered on successful pickup.",
    "Collectibles can support multiple item types (e.g., mobile phone replacing a star) with per-item pickup messaging/modals.",
    "On pickup of specific collectibles (e.g., the first/mobile), trigger a modal prompt using the same modal system as the first-movement goals prompt.",
    "A dedicated MobilePhoneModal component is used to display the first-collectible pickup prompt (title/description) via the shared gameplay modal system.",
    "A mobile phone pixel asset is added under frontend/public/assets/generated/ and used as the visual for the first collectible item type.",
    "All 7 collectibles/stars should trigger a pickup modal prompt with unique title/description copy; the existing first-collectible modal should be updated to the new first-star text (Barnabus-themed).",
    "All 7 star collectibles now trigger pickup modals with unique copy (via StarPickupModal/shared gameplay modal system); pickup modal text is updated in centralized story/content configuration.",
    "Last star (7th collectible) pickup modal should include an appended completion/congratulations message in its description copy.",
    "After the player closes the last collectible popup, gameplay should terminate/leave the GameView and transition to an outro narrative flow that uses the same line-by-line reveal system as the intro, including a gated Continue button between blocks.",
    "A dedicated OutroFlow (src/features/outro/OutroFlow.tsx) provides an intro-like timed, line-by-line narrative reveal with gated Continue between blocks, entered after gameplay completion (closing the 7th pickup modal).",
    "End-of-game logic should trigger when total unique collectibles collected reaches 7 (the final missing star), not based on a specific star index/ID; the completion modal text formatting requires an empty line with ~12px top margin and bolded 'Congratulations!' followed by 🌟 and a line break."

  "known_issues": [
    "Camera clamping assumes world bounds are larger than the viewport; with a corridor world that can be narrower than the 500px canvas, horizontal camera clamping can collapse to a constant value (camera X becomes effectively fixed).",
    "Backend canister (backend/main.mo) is an empty actor with no methods; the auth/actor scaffolding currently has no functional backend API to call.",
    "Duplicate/global CSS entrypoints exist (frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css); only src/index.css is imported by the app, but the extra file can confuse maintenance.",
    "Current end-game completion message/transition is tied to the '7th star' by ID/order rather than the 7th unique collectible picked up; collecting stars out of order can skip the completion message/transition."
