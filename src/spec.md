# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the first collectible star spawn meaningfully farther from the player start, and simplify the Space key text in the controls legend.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust collectible generation so the closest (first encountered) star is placed noticeably farther downward from the spawn position while keeping 7 total stars inside the corridor and not intersecting obstacles.
- Update the controls legend under the canvas to change “Space to act & collect stars” to “Space to act”, without modifying other control text.

**User-visible outcome:** On a fresh load, the player must travel noticeably downward before reaching the first star, and the controls legend reads: “Arrow keys to move • Space to act • J to tell a joke”.
